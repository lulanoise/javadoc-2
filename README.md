# Exercise: javadoc-2
* have a quick look at the [Java arithmetic operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op1.html)
* create a class called `ArithmeticOperators` that has 4 methods:
  * `sum()` method that takes 2 int parameters as input called `num1` and `num2` and returns their summation int
  * `sub()` method that takes 2 int parameters as input called `num1` and `num2` and returns their subtraction int
  * `mul()` method that takes 2 int parameters as input called `num1` and `num2` and returns their multiplication int
  * `div()` method that takes 2 int parameters as input called `num1` and `num2` and returns their division int
* create a class called `Tester` that has the `main` method where you:
  * create a new `ArithmeticOperators` object
  * print in console the result of the 4 methods invocations, passing them (as params) int numbers as you like
* add `Javadoc` comments to:
  * the 2 classes with a short description and the author
  * the 5 methods with a short description, the parameters and the return value
* create a folder called `GeneratedJavadoc` under the main project folder
* generate the Javadoc file using the [IntelliJ Javadoc plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7157-javadoc) right inside the newly created folder
* explore the freshly generated Javadoc
